# Notice
> [!NOTE]
>**This script will install [JDT Language Server](https://github.com/eclipse-jdtls/eclipse.jdt.ls) in your termux to use with [Helix-editor](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix), if you don't want to use this editor, consider using [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim) as it already has support for installing jdtls alone**

# Usage
> [!TIP]
>+ `git clone https://github.com/WestSideDev/jdtls-termux`
>+ `cd jdtls-termux/`
>+ `chmod +x install`
>+ `./install`
>+ 
>**or**
>+ `./install link_release_jdtls`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **You can get the link to the latest version [here](https://download.eclipse.org/jdtls/milestones/),after that be patient because the first time you run helix on a java project it will take a while to detect, you may need to close it and open it again.**
